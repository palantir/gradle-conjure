    Set the path sensitivity of ConjureGeneratorTask sources

    This allows the Gradle build cache to function across different
    machines (or different repo locations on the same file system)
    when running ConjureGeneratorTasks.

    ## Before this PR
    Remote Gradle build caching works for compileIr tasks, but not e.g. compileConjureObjects tasks.

    ## After this PR
    Remote Gradle build caching works for ConjureGeneratorTasks.

    ## Possible downsides?
    If a custom generator uses the non-relative part of the source path (i.e. the repo location) for something, caching could become inaccurate. This seems unlikely to be something someone would do intentionally. A possible protection against this would be passing a relative path to `outputDirectoryFor` rather than an absolute path. That would protect against `outputDirectoryFor` overrides, though not `compileFiles` overrides.
