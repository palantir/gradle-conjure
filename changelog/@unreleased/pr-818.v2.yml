    Disallow non-generated dirs in main sourcesets

    ## Before this PR
    The conjure-consumer dependency scanning strategy relies on annotations
    in Generated Java code to determine minimum service dependencies. This does
    not work for any non-generated code.

    To prevent unexpected problems, all non-generated code must be excluded
    from the Conjure generated Javaprojects.

    ## After this PR
    Gradle will error out whenever it finds a non-generated source directory in any of the Java (e.g. objects, dialogue) generated subprojects

    ## Possible downsides?
    Users must move non generated code outside of the generated subprojects if they want to continue using gradle-conjure
